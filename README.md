# 1. Introduction

A feature for discovering and loading implementations matching a given interface: Service Provider Interface (SPI).

# 2. JDK SPI

## 2.1 Terms and Definitions of Java SPI

Java SPI defines four main components.

### 2.1.1 Service

A well-known set of programming interfaces and classes that provide access to some specific application functionality or feature.

### 2.1.2 Service Provider Interface

An interface or abstract class that acts as a proxy or an endpoint to the service. If the service is one interface, then it is the same as a service provider interface. Service and SPI together are well-known in the Java Ecosystem as API.

### 2.1.3 Service Provider

A specific implementation of the SPI. The Service Provider contains one or more concrete classes that implement or extend the service type.

A Service Provider is configured and identified through a provider configuration file which we put in the resource directory *META-INF/services*. The file name is the fully-qualified name of the SPI and its content is the fully-qualified name of the SPI implementation.

The Service Provider is installed in the form of extensions, a jar file which we place in the application classpath, the Java extension classpath or the user-defined classpath.

### 2.1.4 ServiceLoader

At the heart of the SPI is the [*ServiceLoader*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) class. This has the role of discovering and loading implementations lazily. It uses the context classpath to locate provider implementations and put them in an internal cache.
